In this program, I applied the basics of Javascript to the problem domain given. I made 3 different functions
that uses different Javascript syntax. Javascript has some similarities with the previous programming languages
I've dealt before. I just have to be extra careful when implementing the syntax.

PLEASE CHECK MASTER BRANCH. (PREVIOUS COMMITS WERE MADE IN IT) :)
